#Assignment 1

#Question 3 (5 points)
#Create a Ridge regression model to predict alcohol content (as in Question 1).

#What to submit
#Submit your Python code as part of your report or if you have separate Python
#code (.py files), write in your report what they are called and where to find 
#them on GitHub.

#Write a brief description of your steps to create your model, including but 
#not limited to the following:
    
#Answer: Ridge regression being a regularised technique for linear regressio
    
#What is the accuracy of your model on the training and test data?

#Answer: 



#How did you tune the hyperparameter of your model?
#Compare this model with the linear regression model in Question 1, did you
#achieve improvement in your result? Whatâ€™s the difference between the two
#models?
